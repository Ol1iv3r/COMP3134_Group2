## How to Use This Project

### 1. **Documentation (`DOC/`)**
- Contains detailed explanations of the graphs, their insights, and the reasoning behind each analysis step.

### 2. **Raw Data (`group_2/`)**
- `customers_2.csv`, `products_2.csv`, `sales_2.csv`: The original data files used for all analyses.

### 3. **Updated Data (`newCSV/`)**
- Contains processed and intermediate data files generated by running the Python scripts in sequence.
- These files are used for further analysis and visualization.

### 4. **Suggestions (`Suggestions/`)**
- Includes the latest recommended market strategies for RetailX, based on the analysis results.

### 5. **Python Scripts**
- **Run Order:**  
  1. `stage0_customer.py`, `stage0_products.py`, `stage0_sales.py` (Stage 0: Data characteristics analysis)
  2. `stage1_RFM&Kmeans.py` (Stage 1: Customer segmentation)
  3. `stage2_RandomForestPredictiveModeling.py` (Stage 2: Predictive modeling)
  4. `stage3_Product&SalesPatternAnalysis.py` (Stage 3: Product & sales pattern analysis)
- **Note:**  
  - Scripts must be run in the above order (except for stage0) to ensure that the updated data in `newCSV/` is generated correctly for subsequent steps.

## Workflow

1. **Start with the raw data** in `group_2/`.
2. **Run the Python scripts in order** (Stage 0 → Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3).
3. **Updated data** will be saved in `newCSV/` after each stage.
4. **Refer to the documentation** in `DOC/` for detailed analysis and rationale.
5. **Review the market strategy** in `Suggestions/` for actionable recommendations.
